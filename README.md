# conus404-metadata
The workflows and files in this repository were initially created as part of the ScienceBase data release process.
The `metadata_output_files` directory contains the current official metadata files for CONUS404 model output. These
files were used to provide useful metadata on ScienceBase about the variables contained in the model output files.
They are also used by the processing workflows that create cloud-optimized ZARR datasets from the original WRF model 
output files. The ZARR datasets contain the same metadata as provided on ScienceBase.
